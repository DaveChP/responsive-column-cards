Responsive card design
Begin with Jen Simmons' page:

Initial modifications: rename to styles.css, modify link inside index.html

Desired Features
The layout resembles that of keep.google.com. In particular, the cards, and content within them, vary in height. The column layout is responsive, changing from four columns, through 3, 2, and 1. Columns remain equal width. It's ver nice. The only immediately obvious missing feature is an absence of re-ordering - cards fill columns downwards so their order changes when the page responds to widths. 

Modifications
Initial commit is unchanged from original, bar renaming styles.css and the link to it from index.html
