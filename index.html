    <h3>1) We Love Card Displays</h3>
    <p>Like ubiquitous post-it sticky notes above office desks, card displays are all the rage across the internet. Whether providing comprehensive information, or just a teaser of what's linked from them, they're a perfect way of presenting lots of articles.</p>

    <h3>3) Columns are Easy to Read</h3>
    <p>It's no accident that Newspapers use columns to present text. Could you imagine reading across lines that go on for ever on your daily tube commute? The problem with css columns is that you might well have to scroll down a page to read content at the bottom of the first column before scrolling back up to continue at the top of the second column. For card displays in particular, it would be nice if the sequential elements were always at a similar scroll height regardless of the number of columns a device was currently showing.</p>

    <h3>4) But in a Gloriously Imperfect World, Not Everything Fits in the Same Space</h3>
    <p>Most web card-layouts are restricted to cards of the same height, forcing content to meet an arbitray size or needing empty space beneath smaller articles.</p>

    <p>CSS has led to magnificent layouts that work well on computer screens, tablets, and mobile devices. The days of tiny web pages on smart phones are behind us!</p>

    <p>Despite their beauty, columns have to be read top-to bottom. That's fine on a smart phone because you'll only see one column...</p>

    <h3>7) But When Is a Column Still a Column?</h3>
    <p>That single column on your smart phone is probably not going to occupy the full width of your smart TV or computer screen. We want real columns! But a card at the top of column 2 or 3 on your wide desktop computer monitor, will usually be way down the single column on your smartphone screen.</p>

    <h3>8) The Times They Are-a-Changing Perhaps?</h3>
    <p>Google Keep is a wonderful example of a card layout presented in columns - where cards can, and do, have different heights. Check it out, it allows you to keep notes and web snippets nicely contained and presented.</p>

    <h3>9) What's the Latest? - More Importantly, <i>Where's</i> the Latest?</h3>
    <p>Blogs and social media would be pretty tedious if you had to scroll past all the old news to get to the new stuff so new content in a blog goes at the top ofcourse! For static content that progresses to tell a story, like this page, the story should start at the top of the page and finish at the bottom. The cards on this page are numbered so the exact intended order can be followed. The next card in the sequence will always be pretty close to the one preceding it, even if perfect left-to-right order is not preserved.</p>

    <h3>10) What Happens to the Top Row when 4 Columns Become 3, or 2, or 1?</h3>
    <p>Well, stuff gets pushed down, but how far? CSS grid or even float can be used to keep items ordered but they are not easily used to cards of variable height. While CSS columns, beautiful and simple, load cards downwards, just like the newspaper. You might only get the correct order when a single column is used! </p>

    <h3>11) We Need Priority!</h3>
    <p>The order of cards in the mobile phone single column needs to change if high-priority stuff is to stay near the top. The top of a second column might have been the 50th item in the single column before it was split!</p>

    <h3>12) Google Fixed it in Google Keep</h3>
    <p>Look back at that earlier card showing Google Keep presented as four columns. In this card, the same display has been shrunk to two but, look at the item order! Google has managed to place cards of different heights into responsive columns but keep high priority items at the top.</p>

    <h3>13) How Did Google do it?</h3>
    <p>It's complicated... actually, your guess is as good as mine. They have thousands of the best programmers in the world but their brilliant solutions are not easy to work out by inspecting their work.</p>

    <h3>14) What about this page?</h3>
    <p>Have a play, resize the window. A laptop screen will hold at least 4 columns, maybe more. View it full screen and resized to fewer and fewer columns, down to a single column. The order is never far away from what we want and always navigable.</p>

    <h3>15) So, How Does This Page Work?</h3>
    <p>Each card is a single article element (it could be a div but we like semantic tags, don't we?). The responsive columns result from the very simple css columns property, supplemented only with the break-inside property being set to avoid-column to stop a division at the bottom of the column being shared with the top of the next column</p>

    <h3>16) And What About Re-Ordering on Resize?</h3>
    <p>We use some javascript to read a custom data attribute added to the html article tags that give a numeric priority. The heights of each card are read from the browser and used to calculate a position order to that each card of the next highest priority is added to the shortest column above it. The details can be seen by viewing the source code.</p>

    <h3>17) How is Priority Assigned to a Card?</h3>
    <p>A simple custom data attribute is added to each card container (article tag). It's value is easily read in javascript. For applications like a blog, the values can be shifted as new content is added, to place new content at the top of the page, where it's wanted.</p>
